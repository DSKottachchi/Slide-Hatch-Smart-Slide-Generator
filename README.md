To get started with running the application on your local computer follow the below instructions:

*********************************************************************************************************************************************

--- FRONTEND SETUP ---
Open up the project folder in a IDE of your choice (VSCode is preferred)
Open up the terminal and run: npm install (to create the node modules folder)

--- BACKEND SETUP ---
Firstly you will have to connect to the database. Next step is to get your python packages installed. For this I would recommend you to install it in a virtual environment with for example, conda or you can install it to you local python path, but make sure that there won't be any version conflicts. In order for you to install tha required packages, I have included a 'requirements.txt' file with all the packages that I have used to run it on my local machine. You can simply install these packages by running the command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

--- RUNNING ON BROWSER ---
Type in the command "npm run dev"

*********************************************************************************************************************************************

That is all that is there to it, hope it runs on your local machine. If you have any problems in setting it up, make sure to email me via: dskottachchi@uclan.ac.uk
